use yakui_core::{widget::Widget, Response};

use crate::util::widget_children;

/**
A [Stack] widget. This widget does nothing interesting on its own, but
when used "inside" other layouts, such as [List](crate::widgets::List),
it will stacks its own children, rather than following the layout of its own parent.
This internal layouting is just using yakui's default layout algorithm.

Responds with [StackResponse].

Shorthand:
```rust
# let _handle = yakui_widgets::DocTest::start();
yakui::column(|| {
    yakui::label("on top");
    yakui::stack(|| {
        // this would compose, by being stacked,
        // to appear like "hello world", barring issues from spacing,
        // as opposed to continuing the columnar layout setup above.
        yakui::text(12.0, "hello");
        yakui::text(12.0, "      world");
    });
    yakui::label("on bottom");
});
```
